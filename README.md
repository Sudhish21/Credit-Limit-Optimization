### Purpose of the Project
This project aims to develop a predictive model to classify financial behavior into "Good Risk" or "Bad Risk" using customer demographic information, financial behavior characteristics, and payment data. The model employs machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the risk category of customers, which can be instrumental for financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

### Project Significance
The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize the risk assessment process in financial sectors. By accurately classifying the risk associated with lending to different customers, the project can help minimize financial losses and optimize lending strategies. It also contributes to the broader field of credit risk modeling by providing insights into effective feature selection, data preprocessing, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

### Major Findings and Conclusions
The project concluded that logistic regression, while providing an initial baseline for classification with an accuracy of 84%, exhibited a significant bias towards predicting the majority class. Further exploration with an XGBoost classifier and parameter optimization through GridSearchCV indicated potential improvements in model performance. The analysis revealed the importance of feature selection and engineering, demonstrating how specific features like payment normality and account age significantly impact model predictions. The project underscores the challenge of classifying imbalanced datasets and suggests future exploration into SMOTE, advanced models, or ensemble techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.

### How to Commence and Initiate the Project?
1. **Data Preparation:** Merge customer demographic and payment datasets on the customer identification number.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values by imputing with median for numerical and mode for categorical data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to understand feature distributions, detect outliers, and visualize correlations using histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
4. **Feature Selection and Engineering:** Apply techniques to select relevant features and engineer new ones, like calculating account age days.
5. **Model Training:** Split the data into training and test sets. Train a logistic regression model and an XGBoost classifier, evaluating each model's performance.
6. **Parameter Tuning:** Use GridSearchCV with the XGBoost classifier to find the best model parameters.
7. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Overall Summary and Concluding Thoughts
The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to financial risk classification, emphasizing the need for meticulous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. While logistic regression provided a foundational model, the use of XGBoost and parameter optimization revealed avenues for significant performance enhancements. This project highlights the challenges in dealing with imbalanced data and the importance of choosing the right metrics for model evaluation. Future work could explore more advanced techniques and models to further improve predictive performance, offering valuable insights for credit risk management.
